          <p>My final year project required me to research the viability of an
            <em>electromagnetic launch mechanism</em> (EML) to launch miniature
            satellites into low Earth orbit (LEO).<br>
            I taught myself advance electromagnetism mathematics and concepts
            and used the <em>Biot-Savart Law</em> to create an equation specific
            to the magnetic strength and Lorentz force of projectiles at any point
            of the launcher barrel. This provided information regarding the required
            constraints for a desired launch velocity.<br>
            Other aspects of the project included the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Simulated the airflow around different projectile nose cones
              (including standard cone, ellipitcal, Kaarman and von Haack), using
              FEA applications.</li>
            <li>Created and proposed barrel designs using CAD applications.</li>
            <li>Explored and evaluated alternative launch mechanisms.</li>

          <p>Balancell is a start-up based in <em>Cape Town, South Africa</em>,
            specialising in Battery Management Systems (BMS). I had the chance to
            work amongst a small team of less than ten people, allowing me to gain
            experience across a number of roles in the company.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>I used Python 3 to create data analysis tools to parse through
              extensive data logs and event logs receieved from Battery Energy Meters
              (BEMS) in the field.</li>
            <li>I created applications for data visulisation and to sort and
              compress useful data from raw data logs.</li>
            <li>I monitored and compared data logs to determine unexpected behaviour
              and event occurrences, which I then communicated to other departments.</li>
            <li>I monitored patterns in battery usage and tracked customersâ€™ usage
              of batteries, to provide tailored customer advice regarding battery
              usage and maintenance.</li>
            <li>I identified that devices experienced multiple unexpected restarts
              during boot-up, thereby allowing Balancell to produce a targeted
              solution to resolve the issue.</li>
            <li>I aided in assembly line and manufacture of final battery system
              products and helped to ensure that battery packs were put together
              for proposed deadlines.</li>
            <li>I created, reviewed and edited specifications and guides regarding
              battery construction (inclduing BEMs and WiFi enabled components) for
              clients/end users.</li>
            <li>I aided in design of prototype production jigs.</li>
            <li>I liaised with suppliers to ensure that battery system components
              were delivered correctly and within set deadlines.</li>
            <li>I met with stakeholders to showcase product, explaining product
              capabilities and demonstrating functionality.</li>
